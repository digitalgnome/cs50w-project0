### Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This site contains four html pages that are linked through a bootstrap navigation component. The home or index.html page serves a general landing page listing the requirements for the project.

Other pages include: about.html describing in more the topics covered in the EdX.org CS50W course; SCSS @extend that uses SCSS inheritance; a programming.html page that list the web tecnologies and tools used for this project; a links.html page that lists resources used for completing this project.

The footer copyright date is dynamically generated and will change from year to year automatically because it is parsed from the JavaScript Date object, which was converted to a string, and year referenced from it after spliting that string intro an array.
